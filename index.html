        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Yvonne PengSyuan Lin, a senior at Northeastern University, majoring in Finance & Fintech with a minor in Data Science. 
            My passion lies at the intersection of finance, technology, and data analytics, and I enjoy exploring how quantitative strategies can be used 
            to make better financial decisions.
        </p>

            I’ve completed two co-op experiences that have shaped my career path:
            <ul>
                <li>My first co-op was at Morgan Stanley as a Mortgage-Backed Securities coop, where I was on the trading desk working along traders, porfolio analysts, 
                    and portfolio managers.</li>
                <li>My second co-op I decided to dive more into a data-driven role at Wellington Management, where I worked as Quantitative Trading Research Analytics coop 
                    that focused on quantitative trading strategies. 
                    
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of school, I have a deep love for cafe hopping for matcha and coffee. I’ve been exploring different matcha and coffee shops around Boston, 
            trying different blends, flavors, and brewing techniques. To track the places that I've been to, I use Beli, an app that helps me discover 
            and rate unique spots. 
            My top three cafes in Boston include number 1 is Ogawa Coffee, number 2 is Tatte, and number 3 is Phin Coffee House.
            The matcha latte at Ogawa Coffee is my favorite, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves matcha and is rich in flavor.
            Tatte has good latte and I like how it taste very smooth and creamy. 
            Phin Coffee House has a very unique Vietnamese coffee that I like to drink when I want to try something different and my go to is the cream latte.
